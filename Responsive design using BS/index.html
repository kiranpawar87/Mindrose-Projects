                            <b>Nature,</b> in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural, physical, or material world or
                            universe."Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
                            It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. The study of nature is science.The word
                            nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition",
                            and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek
                            word physis,which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants,animals,
                            and other features of the world develop of their own accord.

                               The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
                               original notion;it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic
                               philosophers,and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the
                               advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.Within the various uses of
                               the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife.Nature may refer to the general
                               realm of various types of living plants and animals,and in some cases to the processes
                               associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change
                               of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy
                               of which all these things are composed.It is often taken to mean the "natural environment"
                               or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not
                               been substantially altered by human intervention.

                                Manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature,
                                unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature".This more
                                traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction
                                between the natural and natural things which can still be found within the various uses.

                            Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the
                            unnatural or the supernatural.Earth (or, "the earth") is the only planet known to support life,
                            and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the
                            solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the
                            fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions,
                            two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.
